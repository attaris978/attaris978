I'm Ryan Magro.
✨I’m passionate about finding solutions to problems; expanding the scope of imagined possibilities; working with others possessed of strong minds, kind hearts, and aggressive aspirations; and in always growing, always learning, and always improving prospects.
🌱 I’m currently advancing my knowledge of TypeScript and Python, while actively employing my existent skillset.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any number of challenging projects -- I have the work ethic and inherent problem-solving ability to transcend limitations and would welcome the chance to grow.
