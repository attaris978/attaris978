- 👋 Hi, I’m @attaris978
- 👀 I’m interested in...
-     finding solutions to problems,
-     in expanding the scope of imagined possibilities,
-     in working with others possessed of strong minds, kind hearts, and aggressive aspirations,
-     and in always growing, always learning, and always improving prospects.
- 🌱 I’m currently...
-     studying full stack web development. My familiarity thus far is with Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to...
-     collaborate on any number of challenging projects -- I have the work ethic and inherent problem-solving ability to push past any present limitation and would welcome the chance to grow.
- 📫 How to reach me:
